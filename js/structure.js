/* SNACK 1
        Dwayne Johnson has asked us to create place cards for the guest table at his mega VIP party. 
        He left us the name of the table ("VIP Table") and the list of guests in seating order:
        ['Brad Pitt', 'Johnny Depp', 'Lady Gaga', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Georgina Rodriguez', 'Chiara Ferragni',  'George Clooney', 'Amal Clooney', 'Fedez', 'Amadeus', 'Fiorello']
        But the typography company that will print everything wants us to send them a list of guests in a specific format, 
        so we need to ensure that each guest is a JavaScript object with the following properties:
            -table name (tableName),
            -guest name (guestName),
            -place occupied (place).

        Generate and print the list for the place cards in the console.

// Create a variables already know : array variable  guestList with names of guest
// Create a string variable with name of table
// Create an arrow function return an object with required properties in required format
// Create an array method to call the function for each guest
// Print in console card list

We have a list of students from a University, identified by ID, Name, and their total exam grades.
To prepare the classroom for a new course, 
- We need to print the name tags of the students: 
1- Create a list containing their names all in uppercase.
2- We need to create a list of all students who have a total grade higher than 70.
3- We need to create a list of all students who have a total grade higher than 70 and an ID higher than 120.
*/
// 1.
// Create a array variable variable containing given object list of students
// Create a function returning list names of student in UPPERCASE
// Create array method to call this function for each student

// 2.
// Create a function returning a boolean in condition:  grade > 70.
// Use Filter method callind this function to get the students based on condition
// Print in console name of this filter method

// 3.
// Added in higher existing function one more consition id > 120

        Create an array of objects:
        Each object will describe a racing bike with the following properties: name and weight.
        Print to the console the bike with the smallest weight using destructuring and template literal.

*/

// Use an reduce() method to check smallest weight bike, initializeed from the first object
// Craete the condition
// Print in console

        Create an array of football teams objects.
        Each team will have properties: name, points scored, fouls conceded.
        The name will be the only property to be filled in, the others will all be set to 0.
        Generate random numbers instead of the 0s in the properties: points scored and fouls.
        Finally, using destructuring, create a new array whose elements contain only names and fouls and print everything to the console.

// Create teams object array
// Create variables i need
// Define functions
// Use a method using desctructuring  to compleat points and foult, and return object with names and foults
