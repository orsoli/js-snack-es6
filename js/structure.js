/* SNACK 1
Dwayne Johnson has asked us to create place cards for the guest table at his mega VIP party. 
He left us the name of the table ("VIP Table") and the list of guests in seating order:
['Brad Pitt', 'Johnny Depp', 'Lady Gaga', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Georgina Rodriguez', 'Chiara Ferragni',  'George Clooney', 'Amal Clooney', 'Fedez', 'Amadeus', 'Fiorello']
But the typography company that will print everything wants us to send them a list of guests in a specific format, 
so we need to ensure that each guest is a JavaScript object with the following properties:
    -table name (tableName),
    -guest name (guestName),
    -place occupied (place).

Generate and print the list for the place cards in the console.

// Create a variables already know : array variable  guestList with names of guest
// Create a string variable with name of table
// Create an arrow function return an object with required properties in required format
// Create an array method to call the function for each guest
// Print in console card list
